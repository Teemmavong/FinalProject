"""
This project is a program that helps calculate the amount of pay a person working
two jobs would get. We need to first identify the formula for pay for each job. 
We multiple the hours * wage unless there is overtime of > 40 hours worked in which
case it becomes wage * hours + 1.5 * wage - (hours -40). We use this equation for 
both jobs. We then ask the user to input the information of their hours and wage
to evaluate an answer.
